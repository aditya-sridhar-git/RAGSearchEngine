Climate change represents one of the most pressing challenges facing humanity in the 21st century. Rising global temperatures, driven primarily by greenhouse gas emissions from human activities, are causing profound changes to Earth's climate systems. The effects are already visible in the form of more frequent extreme weather events, melting polar ice caps, and rising sea levels.

The Paris Agreement, adopted by 196 parties in 2015, aims to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Countries have committed to reducing their carbon emissions through various means, including transitioning to renewable energy sources like solar and wind power, improving energy efficiency, and protecting forests that act as carbon sinks.

Individual actions also matter in the fight against climate change. Reducing personal carbon footprints through choices like using public transportation, consuming less meat, and supporting sustainable businesses can collectively make a significant impact. Education and awareness are crucial for mobilizing global action on this existential threat.
