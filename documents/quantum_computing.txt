Quantum computing represents a paradigm shift in information processing. Unlike classical computers that use bits representing either 0 or 1, quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits that can exist in superposition, simultaneously representing both states. This property, along with quantum entanglement, allows quantum computers to perform certain calculations exponentially faster than classical computers.

The potential applications of quantum computing are vast. In cryptography, quantum computers could break many current encryption methods, necessitating the development of quantum-resistant algorithms. In drug discovery, they could simulate molecular interactions with unprecedented accuracy, accelerating the development of new medicines. Optimization problems in logistics, finance, and artificial intelligence could be solved much more efficiently.

However, building practical quantum computers faces significant challenges. Qubits are extremely fragile and susceptible to interference from their environment, a problem known as decoherence. Maintaining qubits in a quantum state requires near-absolute-zero temperatures. Despite these hurdles, companies like IBM, Google, and startups are making steady progress, with Google claiming quantum supremacy in 2019 by performing a calculation that would take classical supercomputers thousands of years.
